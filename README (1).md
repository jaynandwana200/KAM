# Key Account Manager (KAM) Lead Management System

## Overview
Udaan's Key Account Manager (KAM) Lead Management System is a comprehensive, Django-based platform designed to optimize the management of leads, interactions, and account performance for large restaurant accounts. This system supports Key Account Managers in effectively tracking leads, planning calls, and monitoring account performance.

The application integrates advanced tools like Celery, Celery Beat, Redis, and MySQL to provide efficient task scheduling, data management, and asynchronous operations. Additionally, it features an automated email notification system to alert Key Account Managers upon lead allocation, ensuring timely follow-ups and proactive engagement.

## Features

### 1. Lead Management
- Add, update, and delete restaurant leads with detailed information.
- Monitor lead status transitions with automatic data updates.
- **Notify Key Account Managers via email when a lead is allocated to them.**
- Remove interactions of inactive leads to maintain a clean database.
- **Notify Key Acoount managers about allocation and deallocation of Lead via email on change of Key account manager.**

  - Call frequency.
  - Last interaction date.
- View a daily call plan to streamline communication.

### 5. Performance Monitoring
